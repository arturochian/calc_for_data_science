Assuming coverage will be as summarized in "What to Cover," this is an attempt to outline an order of presentation. Each topic might encompass more than one lesson.

NOTE: I've omitted the FFT since it requires complex numbers which are otherwise unnecessary. (Principal components involve positive semidefinite matrices and forms.)

1. Calculus, Vectors, and Matrices -- What are they good for?
  * Prerequisites: R Programming lessons basic building blocks, vectors and matrices.
  * What are they about? What are they good for? Coin flip and the two great modeling technologies. Models as mimics. Computer revolution. 
  * Origins: lines, distance, curves, tangents, lengths, and areas in the plane.
2. Vectors and Matrices with illustrations in the plane
  * Cartesian coordinates
  * Rotations and scaling
  * Matrix multiplication; linearity
  * Matrix inversion; solving linear equations
  * Circles and ellipses
  * Euclidean distance and quadratic forms (with representation as (x-m)'M(x-m) + constant)
  * Inner products
3. Limits and infinitesimals
4. Slopes and areas, derivatives and integrals
  * Inner products on finite dimensional function spaces, e.g., polynomials of degree n or less. Means and variances?
5. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
6. Partial derivatives and multiple integrals
7. The behavior of derivatives at extrema
  * For functions of one variable
  * For functions of two variables, example of minimizing unconstrained and constrained quadratic forms; Lagrange multipliers
  * General case: OLS and eigenvalues of positive semidefinite forms
