Assuming converage will be as summarized in "What to Cover," this is an attempt to outline an order of presentation. Each topic might encompass more than one lesson.

1. Calculus, Vectors, and Matrices -- What are they good for?
  * Prerequisites: R Programming lessons basic building blocks, vectors and matrices.
  * Motivating examples, including lines, curves, tangents, lengths, and areas.
2. Vectors and Matrices with illustrations in the plane
  * Cartesian coordinates
  * Rotations and scaling
  * Matrix multiplication; linearity
  * Matrix inversion and solving linear equations
  * Circles and ellipses
  * Euclidean distance and quadratic forms (with representation as (x-m)'M(x-m) + constant)
3. Limits and infinitesimals
4. Slopes and areas, derivatives and integrals
5. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
6. Partial derivatives and multiple integrals
7. The behavior of derivatives at extrema
  * For functions of one variable
  * For functions of two variables, example of minimizing unconstrained and constrained quadratic forms; Lagrange multipliers
  * General case: OLS and eigenvalues
