1. The point of this unit (lesson or lessons) is to illustrate the main concepts visually, using plane figures.

2. Plane geometry is about lines and curves. Thanks to Ren√© Descartes, 1596-1650, it is also about Cartesian coordinates, which is what the light blue grid lines are about. 
  * We can specify any point in the plane by its x and y coordinates. The circle's center, for instance, has x coordinate 8 and y coordinate 6. One end of the line is at x=1 and y=6, the other at x=5, y=9. 
  * Using `points(x, y, pch=19, cex=3, col="green")` put a fat, green point at coordinates, x and y, of your choice; just be sure both x and y are between 0 and 10 so your point appears on the graph.
  * Thus, any point in the plane can be represented by a vector of 2 numbers. In R we'd represent the circle's center as `c(8,6)` and the endpoints of the line as `c(1,6)` and `c(5, )`.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold'}
plot(c(0,10), c(0,10), type='n', xlab="x", ylab="y", main="Lines and curves")
abline(h=0:10, col="lightblue", lwd=2)
abline(v=0:10, col="lightblue", lwd=2)
segments(1,6,5,9, lwd=3)
points(c(1,5),c(6,9), pch=19, cex=1.5)
points(5, 9, pch=19, cex=1.5)
points(8,6,cex=25,lwd=3)
points(8,6, pch=19, cex=1.5, col=2)
x <- seq(-1, 11, by=.5)
lines(x, 1+sin(.2*pi*x), lwd=3)
```

3. A line has a length and a slope. Thanks to Pythagoras, we can calculate the length of a line segment

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold'}
plot(c(0,10), c(0,10), type='n', xlab="x", ylab="y", main="Line segments have slopes and lengths.")
abline(h=0:10, col="lightblue", lwd=2)
abline(v=0:10, col="lightblue", lwd=2)
segments(1,6,5,9, lwd=3)
points(c(1,5),c(6,9), pch=19, cex=1.5)
segments(1,6,5,6, lty=2, lwd=3, col=2)
segments(5,6,5,9, lty=2, lwd=3, col=2)
text(3.25, 5.5, expression(4), lwd=3, cex=1.5, col=2)
text(5.25, 7.5, expression(3), lwd=3, cex=1.5, col=2)
text(2.5, 8.5, expression(sqrt(4^2 + 3^2)), lwd=3, cex=1.5, col=1)
text(1.1, 8.5, "length = ", lwd=3, cex=1.5, col=1)
text(5.75, 5, expression(frac(3,4)), lwd=3, cex=1.5, col=2)
text(4.8, 5, "slope = ", lwd=3, cex=1.5, col=2)
```

3. The closer you look at a smooth curve, the more it looks like a line.
