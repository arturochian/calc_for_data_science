1. The point of this unit (lesson or lessons) is to illustrate the main concepts visually, using plane figures.

2. Plane geometry is about lines and curves. Thanks to Ren√© Descartes, 1596-1650, it is also about Cartesian coordinates, which is what the light blue grid lines are about. 
  * We can specify any point in the plane by its x and y coordinates. The circle's center, for instance, has x coordinate 8 and y coordinate 6. One end of the line is at x=1 and y=6, the other at x=5, y=9. 
  * Using `points(x, y, pch=19, cex=3, col="green")` put a fat, green point at coordinates, x and y, of your choice; just be sure both x and y are between 0 and 10 so your point appears on the graph.
  * Thus, any point in the plane can be represented by a vector of 2 numbers. In R we'd represent the circle's center as `c(8,6)` and the endpoints of the line as `c(1,6)` and `c(5, )`.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold'}
plot(c(0,10), c(0,10), type='n', xlab="x", ylab="y", main="Lines and curves")
abline(h=0:10, col="lightblue", lwd=2)
abline(v=0:10, col="lightblue", lwd=2)
segments(1,6,5,9, lwd=3)
points(c(1,5),c(6,9), pch=19, cex=1.5)
points(5, 9, pch=19, cex=1.5)
points(8,6,cex=25,lwd=3)
points(8,6, pch=19, cex=1.5, col=2)
x <- seq(-1, 11, by=.5)
lines(x, 1+sin(.2*pi*x), lwd=3)
```

3. A line has a slope and a length. 
  * A line's slope is the simplest example of a *derivative*. In the figure, if x increases by 1, then y increases by 3/4. We say that 3/4 is the rate of change of y with respect to x, or the derivative of y with respect to x.
  * According to Pythagoras, "The square on the hypotenuse, is equal to the sum of the squares on its other two sides." Thus we can calculate the length of a line from the coordinates of its endpoints.
  * The square on the hypotenuse, $3^2+4^2$ in the figure, the simplest example of a *quadratic form*. It is called *quadratic* because of the squares, and *form*, is short for formula.
  * The line's length, of course, is the square root of the quadratic form.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold'}
plot(c(0,10), c(0,10), type='n', xlab="x", ylab="y", main="Line segments have slopes and lengths.")
abline(h=0:10, col="lightblue", lwd=2)
abline(v=0:10, col="lightblue", lwd=2)
segments(1,6,5,9, lwd=3)
points(c(1,5),c(6,9), pch=19, cex=1.5)

text(5.25, 7.5, expression(3), lwd=3, cex=1.5, col=2)
text(2.5, 8.5, expression(sqrt(4^2 + 3^2)), lwd=3, cex=1.5, col=1)
text(1.1, 8.5, "length = ", lwd=3, cex=1.5, col=1)
text(5.75, 5, expression(frac(3,4)), lwd=3, cex=1.5, col=2)
text(4.8, 5, "slope = ", lwd=3, cex=1.5, col=2)
```

3. The closer you look at a smooth curve, the more it looks like a line.
  * In the figure, we're zooming in on the x axis around the coordinate x=1.
  * In the upper left we're looking at the interval between x=0 and x=2. In the upper right we zoom in to an interval 5 times smaller, and so on. By the time we're at an interval 50 times smaller, the line and the curve are indistiguishable by eye.
  * By a process such at this, we can assign a slope to a point on a curve. Such a slope is called the derivative of the curve and written $\frac{dy}{dx}$.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold'}
local({
  mags <- c(1, 5, 10, 50)
   par(mfrow=c(2, 2))
 for(i in mags){
    x0 <- 1
    y0 <- x0^2
    x <- seq(x0 - 1/i, x0 + 1/i, length.out=50)
    y <- x^2
    plot(x, y, type='n', xlab=expression(x), ylab=expression(y), 
         main=paste0("Zoom = ", i*100,"%"))
    lines(x, y, lwd=3)
    points(x0, y0, pch=19, cex=1.5, col="red")
    abline(x0^2-2*x0*x0, 2*x0, lwd=3, lty=2, col="red")
  }
 par(mfrow=c(1,1))
})

```
